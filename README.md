The Parking Lot Project is a multi-step project that helps participants understand and learn different nuances and aspects of python. The requirements of the project is to create a parking lot with atleast 10 spots
of the same size with the ability to reserve a spot, find a free spot, and free a spot. The expected outcome of the project is that an end user can run the program, reserve up to 10 cars, free and print the 
available spots at any given time. The project will then be expanded into a website application so it will be a more interactive experience for end users.
